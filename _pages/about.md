I'm Shaon Sikder, Experienced AI Engineer (3+ years) advancing Large Language Models, Machine Learning, Deep Learning Algorithms, Data-centric AI crafting ethical, explainable LLMs & AI solutions for realworld impact, prioritizing safety, well-being, and responsible innovation. 

After completing my BSc in Information and Communication Engineering from East West University in Bangladesh, I knew I wanted to dive deeper into artificial intelligence and its real-world applications. My journey began when I joined ADSPL Ltd as an AI engineer, where I cut my teeth developing machine learning models and refining my Python and TensorFlow skills. However, I yearned to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI. This led me to my current role at Easital Technologies, where I lead development of sophisticated AI chatbots powered by advanced large language models like Llama-2, Gemini, GPT-4.

Some highlights so far include:
- Increased user engagement by 20% for a 50+ service mega-app using prompt engineering and innovations like LangChain
- Reduced business card scanning errors by 35% with AI-enabled OCR
- Streamlined model deployment with Docker and CI/CD pipelines on AWS
I believe we've only scratched the surface of AI's potential. My aim is to craft ethical and explainable AI solutions that drive real-world impact. I prioritize safety, well-being, and responsible innovation in my work.

Outside of being an AI nerd, I enjoy teaching others as an AI course instructor. I'm also pursuing research collaborations related to AI fairness and machine learning interpretability.

If you'd like to collaborate, have any questions, or just want to chat AI, feel free to connect with me!
