## AI Engineer
<h3> Easital Technologies </h3
Below are listed all the courses that I have taught as the primary instructor since 2021, with
links to their respective websites.  
I'm Shaon Sikder, Experienced AI Engineer (3+ years) advancing Large Language Models, Machine Learning, Deep Learning Algorithms, Data-centric AI crafting ethical, explainable LLMs & AI solutions for real world impact, prioritizing safety, well-being, and responsible innovation. 

After completing my BSc in Information and Communication Engineering from East West University in Bangladesh, I knew I wanted to dive deeper into artificial intelligence and its real-world applications. My journey began when I joined ADSPL Ltd as an AI engineer, where I cut my teeth developing machine learning models and refining my Python and TensorFlow skills. However, I yearned to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI. This led me to my current role at Easital Technologies, where I lead development of sophisticated AI chatbots powered by advanced large language models like Llama-2, Gemini, GPT-4.

Some highlights so far include:
- Increased user engagement by 20% for a 50+ service mega-app using prompt engineering and innovations like LangChain
- Reduced business card scanning errors by 35% with AI-enabled OCR
- Streamlined model deployment with Docker and CI/CD pipelines on AWS
