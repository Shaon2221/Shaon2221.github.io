I started doing small woodwork projects as a child, during woodwork projects at my primary school <i>Escuela Anexa</i>, and grew up watching my brother and my father's varied projects (i'll include some photos of those below). During the COVID-19 pandemic, I took upon a few woodwork projects, some of which I am very proud of! Below are descriptions of our <a href="#ikea"> first built in boockcase and bench storage living room</a> we made during July 2022 for our new home, and some <a href="#toys">wooden toys</a> I have been making for the Alexander and Nikolay.

<h1 id="ene"> Built in Bookcase  </h1>
 
We begun the project trying to plan our ideal "Ikea Hack", and soon realized we needed something much more sturdy and resilient for our 3 meter high ceilings, so we ended up with a mixture of solid frames and Ikea objects. We made the built-in bookcase together with my husband <a href="https://jamesunwin.github.io/">James Unwin </a> and it took us about 60 hours, and we are so happy with the final product!

Here is how it all started...
