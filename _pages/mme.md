<h2> The Math Map Experiment </h2>
     
    
<br>

Which mathematical world maps can we arrive to if we think collectively? As scientists we are constantly interacting with our peers, being inspired by others' ideas, and inspiring ourselves lines of research. But how do our thoughts and perceptions of mathematics shape the directions in which we do research, and how does our surrounding provide a framing in which to classify the importance of research questions and results? 
 
    
<br>

We will start with an image of a mathematical object, and at each stage, each researcher will be adding a linked concept. This could be a related object, or a result, a correspondence, an open question. As the map grows, more possibilities appear for the next researchers to connect to -- the updated posters will be included here below, with a summarized visual description of how they grew, and a list of relevant sources for those interested in sections of the map.
