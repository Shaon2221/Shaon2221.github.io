I grew up watching my father and my brother building things, sometimes helping myself, but mostly just admiring them. Now that we have our own home, we have started learning how to build thinks ourselves. We first learned how to set  <a href="#base"> a foundation </a> for a shed, which then became very useful at the time of building  <a href="#grill"> an Argentinian grill with bricks </a> in our back yard in Lincoln Park.

<h1 id="base"> Building a Solid Foundation  </h1>
 
We decided to build a shed in our front yard, and so we needed a solid foundation to put it on.  Excavate a trench of undisturbed soil or required bearing

It all started when we bought our family home in June 2022, and had a large room on the second floor which we hope will be our daily play area next to a large office space and a nugget room.

After some drafting we decided to buy the following Billy bookcases and Kallax cubes from Ikea to complement pine wooden frames we would make.

Here is a list of what we bought.

 After building all pre-made parts and choosing separations and positioning, we had to take all the moulding out of the walls and build a robust frame to hold our 3 meter high bookcase and benches. We had no tools apart from my old electric screwdriver, so we got a nice starting set (we're only 10 minute walk from Lincoln Park's home depot and a couple of other great hardware stores!).

 The frame allowed us to add a lot of weight both on the Kallax as well as on the Billy bookcases, and was attached along many points to the studs inside the wall.

The final details are what made the builtin look amazing when finished, so we learned how to use acrylic caulk and wood-fillers of different kinds to make surfaces smooth and any gaps disappear.
