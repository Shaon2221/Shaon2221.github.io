With the deepest sadness, my brother Fidel and I bid farewell to our father, Fidel Arturo Schaposnik, who passed away early Saturday morning in La Plata, Argentina after a month-long battle in the intensive care unit following a hemorrhagic stroke.

He was the best father we could have ever wished for, who taught us the love for science, music, art, cooking, and so much more. He showed us how to appreciate and cultivate friendships, to listen and have a critical mind. He instilled in us the confidence to pursue our dreams, making everything seem within reach with enough effort. He taught us to remember our mother with love, to honor the memory of those who are no longer with us, and to fight for truth and justice.

He leaves us from the pinnacle of a life enjoyed among dear friends, family, and colleagues, organizing dinners every week, doing physics every day. Going to theaters and operas, traveling the world, writing books, and discovering authors. We will miss him deeply, but we will continue to enjoy life in his memory, cherishing him, his stories and his extravagance in every moment, raising his grandchildren under his teachings.

Thirty years later, he rests in peace next to his beloved Patricia, our mother.
