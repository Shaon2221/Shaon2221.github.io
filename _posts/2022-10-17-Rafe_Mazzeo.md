We spent some time talking to Prof.Rafe Mazzeo from Stanford University, for whom the whom the interactions between mathematics and sciences became more compelling.

<blockquote>
    I became very conscious of the beauty of the interactions of maths with physics and more applied areas of mathematics. 
    —Rafe Mazzeo
</blockquote>

 Prof. Mazzeo hopes we will all remain more conscious about our air footprint, and is thankful the online education platforms and styles have developed so much, since they are here to stay. 
 
<blockquote>
Think more about where it is worth traveling
    —Rafe Mazzeo
